<h2>Let's attend</h2>
<div>
    <h3><u>Problem</u></h3> 
Social people get less information about parties and events that happen around them which might even be very 
close to them but due to poor publicity and actual information, they might miss the event, and not just social people,
even organizers might be expecting a high turn up from people and end up having less due to poor publicity.</p>



    <h3><u>Solution</u></h3>
<p>Creating a platform where all of these can be unified, where event organizers can have a dashboard
    where they can create events, set limits to attendees, configure it to suit their exact need and
    recieve updates on the events, amount of tickets gotten, analytics of the gender and their age ranges
    and other details.
    The attendees will also be able to view upcoming events around them of a specified distance radar,
    and also decide to check more events based on a filter or thereabout, register for event, and download
    tickets and recieve them on their emails as wella reference pourposes.

    <h3><u>User persona</u></h3>
    <p>Cynthia is a Techie and she wants to attend a tech event which is within her state of residence,
        Kwara state, but she has no idea on any event or upcoming one, so she heads on to LetsAttend.com
         and set the category of event she's interested in, then she happened to see an upcoming tech event
         in a month time which was just 3km away from her, she gets the ticket and registered for the event 
         and was able to read more on the event and follow them up on the website for futher upcoming events.
